Randomised controlled trial (RCT) literature plays a fundamental role in informing evidence-based medicine and nursing. This paper aims to track geographical and temporal trends in the publication of RCTs in nursing over the past 20 years by means of a bibliometric analysis. The PubMed database was searched for articles published from 1 January 1991 to 31 October 2011 and satisfying this search strategy: nursing [MeSH Terms] AND (RCT OR trial* OR 'experimental study' OR randomised OR randomisation) AND (English[lang]). Abstracts were reviewed to assess whether they met the criteria for an RCT. A manual search of information on country of origin was carried out and Journal Citation ReportsÂ® was used to allocate journals to subject areas. RCT methodology is increasingly drawing the attention of nursing researchers worldwide. However, there is a large disparity in research productivity, at least in terms of number of published RCTs in the English language and listed on PubMed, between the most productive continents, North America and Europe, and the others

Mediating reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is the most classic function of HDL. HDL and HDL-C participate in the entire process of RCT, including cholesterol removal from cells, cholesterol transport in circulation, and cholesterol excretion. As cholesterol is a component of lipid rafts and lipid droplets in cells, HDL and RCT can influence cell activity. HDL has also been shown to be related to the metabolism of some other biological lipids, such as S1P and ox-PL. Here we will introduce in detail the molecular mechanism of HDL participation in RCT and its significance

The double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) is accepted by medicine as objective scientific methodology that, when ideally performed, produces knowledge untainted by bias. The validity of the RCT rests not just on theoretical arguments, but also on the discrepancy between the RCT and less rigorous evidence (the difference is sometimes considered an objective measure of bias). A brief overview of historical and recent developments in "the discrepancy argument" is presented. The article then examines the possibility that some of this "deviation from truth" may be the result of artifacts introduced by the masked RCT itself. Can an "unbiased" method produce bias? Among the experiments examined are those that augment the methodological stringency of a normal RCT in order to render the experiment less susceptible to subversion by the mind. This methodology, a hypothetical "platinum" standard, can be used to judge the "gold" standard. The concealment in a placebo-controlled RCT seems capable of generating a "masking bias." Other potential biases, such as "investigator self-selection," "preference," and "consent" are also briefly discussed. Such potential distortions indicate that the double-blind RCT may not be objective in the realist sense, but rather is objective in a "softer" disciplinary sense. Some "facts" may not exist independent of the apparatus of their production

Placebo injections actually improve lateral epicondylitis at high rates. No other injections convincingly improve it better than placebo.Corticosteroid injection is not superior to saline or anesthetic injection (strength of recommendation [SOR] A, systematic review of randomized controlled trials [RCTs]). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection is not superior to saline injection (SOR A, meta-analysis of RCTs).Botulinum toxin injection, compared to saline injection, modestly improved pain in lateral epicondylitis, but with short-term grip-strength weakness (SOR A, meta-analysis of RCTs). Prolotherapy injection, compared to saline injection, improved pain at 16-week, but not at 8-week, follow-up (SOR B, one small pilot RCT).Hyaluronic acid injection, compared to saline injection, resulted in a statistically significant pain reduction (6%) but did not achieve the minimum clinically important difference (SOR B, single RCT).Autologous blood injection, compared to saline injection, did not improve disability ratings (SOR B, one small RCT)

Randomized control trials (RCT's) are the gold standard in evaluating and efficiently translating research data into clinical practice. The CONSORT statement was conceptualized in order to help ascertain standardization and reproducibility of RCT's. The articles publishing the CONSORT 2010 statement along with their bibliographies were identified and thoroughly reviewed. The CONSORT statement is made up of a 25-item checklist that provides the author with a solid backbone around which to construct and present an RCT. It sets standards on the trial's design, analysis, and interpretation of the results
